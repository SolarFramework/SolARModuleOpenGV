**SolARModuleOpenGB** is a module based on [OpenGV](http://laurentkneip.github.io/opengv/) (Open Geometric Vision)? OpenGV is released under the [FreeBSD license](https://www.freebsd.org/internal/software-license.html).

It is a C++ library designed to solve geometric computer vision problems. It contains efficient implementations of absolute-pose, relative-pose, triangulation, and point-cloud alignment methods for the calibrated case. All problems can be solved for central or non-central cameras, and embedded into a random sample consensus or nonlinear optimization scheme. The library is relying on the adapter pattern, and thus may easily be included into other projects. It furthermore contains a Matlab interface and a full benchmark kit for testing and comparing algorithms against each other.
